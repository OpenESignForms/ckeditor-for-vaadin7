CKEditor is a javascript-based HTML "rich text" WYSIWYG editor that works in common browsers. This JavaScriptComponent? provides a wrapper around it for use in a Vaadin 7-based application.

**THIS PROJECT HAS STALLED. MOST CONTINUE TO USE THE PREVIOUS PROJECT VERSION FOR NOW:**

Unlike our previous [vaadin-ckeditor project](https://code.google.com/p/vaadin-ckeditor/), this does not make use of GWT and thus has no widgetset compiles.

The is developed using Vaadin 7.0.7 and CKEditor 4.1.2 in an Eclipse environment. You simply can drop the JAR file into your Vaadin WEB-INF/lib. No widgetset compilation is needed. We are not currently working on the 'trunk' at all, but instead look at CKEditorForVaadin7 in 'svn'.

*This version is experimental.*

Since Google Code no longer supports a downloads area, you can retrieve the JAR from the 'Source' tab or the Vaadin Directory (not yet there).

NOTE: This widget is compiled using JDK 1.6 / Java 6.

It was built for use in the [Open eSignForms](http://open.esignforms.com/) open source electronic contracting and electronic signature web-based application (SaaS) where forms can be developed for [electronic signatures](http://www.yozons.com/electronicSignatures.jsp), routing, etc.

**NOTE:** *All code contributed to this project will be bundled under the single copyright owner, Yozons Inc., but of course it's released under Apache 2.0 so you are free to do with the code as you please.*
